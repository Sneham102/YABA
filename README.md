Install vscode extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
Problem: you include Tailwind in a project like this, but you get the warning Unknown at rule @tailwindcss(unknownAtRules) in VS Code:

2. Change that to ignore: CSS > Lint: Unknown At Rules: Ignore
